#  SPECT Collimator Monte Carlo Simulation Dashboard

This project simulates **gamma photon transport and collimator response** in a **SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)** system. It was designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate nuclear imaging hardware engineering, detector response modeling, and collimator optimization concepts.

---

## Purpose

This simulation models photon–collimator interactions to estimate:
- **Spatial resolution** and **sensitivity trade-offs**.
- The effects of **hole geometry, septal thickness, and material** on image quality.
- Photon path behavior using simplified **Monte Carlo methods**.

Developed using **React + Recharts + TailwindCSS**, this tool provides an interactive and visually intuitive interface for:
- Adjusting **collimator design parameters**.
- Running photon transport simulations.
- Visualizing **energy spectra** and **collimator performance metrics**.

---

## Features

-  Adjustable parameters for hole size, thickness, and photon energy.  
-  Real-time plots for photon detection and energy distribution.  
-  Basic Monte Carlo randomization for photon angle and absorption events.  
-  Collimator schematic and simulated data visualization.
